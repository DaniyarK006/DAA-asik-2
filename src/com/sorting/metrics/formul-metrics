Formulas for Calculating Selection Sort Metrics

1.Comparisons = n × (n - 1) / 2
 n = 100:   4,950
 n = 1000:  499,500
 n = 10000: 49,995,000
 n = 100000: 4,999,950,000

2.ArrayAccesses = 2 × Comparisons + 4 × Swaps

  Random:
  - Swaps ≈ n/2
  - ArrayAccesses ≈ 2n² + 2n

  Sorted:
  - Swaps = 0
  - ArrayAccesses = 2n²

  Reverse-sorted:
  - Swaps = n-1
  - ArrayAccesses = 2n² + 4(n-1)

  Nearly-sorted (5% swaps):
  - Swaps ≈ n/20
  - ArrayAccesses ≈ 2n² + n/5

3.Swaps
   - Sorted:         0 swaps
   - Random:         n/2 ± 5% swaps
   - Reverse-sorted: n-1 swaps (maximum)
   - Nearly-sorted:  n/20 swaps (5%)

4.Iteration
   - Sorted:         0 swaps
   - Random:         n/2 ± 5% swaps
   - Reverse-sorted: n-1 swaps (maximum)
   - Nearly-sorted:  n/20 swaps (5%)
